START: Overview
====================================================================================================

TSometimes, when we install a product, the environment does not meet all the necessary criteria and
some step from the installation process crushes. What happens with the changes made by the previous
steps that completed successfully? How can the installer undo those changes?

        ================================================================================
        
        The rollback custom action is sequenced before the normal installation custom action.
        
        The Crush custom action will return failure (only if the ERROR_MESSAGE property is not empty)
        and it will trigger, in this way, the rollback process.
