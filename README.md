Sometimes, when we install a product, the environment does not meet all the necessary criteria and some step from the installation process crushes. What happens with the changes made by the previous steps that completed successfully? How can the installer undo those changes?

A step-by-step tutorial can be found in the `/doc/article/README.md` document, [here](doc/article/README.md).
